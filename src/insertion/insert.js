/**
 * Walks the tree rooted at <code>A</code> down the only path that satisfies
 * the following property: if at a node <code>C</code> we make a left (resp.
 * right), then <code>B < C</code> (resp. <code>B >= C</code>). Once we hit the
 * end of the path, we can add node <code>B</code> at this position. By the
 * property of the path, the tree rooted at <code>A</code> is still a binary
 * search tree.
 * For our red-black tree, all that is left to do is fix the red-black tree
 * properties in case they have been violated by this insertion. This is fixed
 * by {@link insert_case0}.
 *
 * @param {Function} compare - The comparison function to use.
 * @param {Node} A - The root of the tree.
 * @param {Node} B - The node to insert.
 * @returns {Node} B - The node that has been inserted.
